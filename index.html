              Wow! This tour made me realize how much I love mountains. After
              going on one of these tours, I can safely say that they are my
              favorite geographic feature, and my favorite word that starts with
              M.

              I never understood why people cared so much about mountains. But
              then I went on one of these tours. Now I can't understand people
              who
              <em>don't</em> care about mountains!

              If you want to understand the universe, head to the mountains. I
              mean, seriously. It's like. whoa. You know? It's like that.
